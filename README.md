# Description:
**myCheetahSim** is a MATLAB-based code repository designed for the modeling of crystal plasticity using finite element methods. This repository provides a comprehensive framework for simulating the mechanical behavior of crystalline materials under various loading conditions.

# Tasks:
- **Theoretical Framework**: Organizing and compiling the theoretical foundations of crystal plasticity finite element theory.
- **Code Development**: Creating and implementing MATLAB code for crystal plasticity simulations.
- **Benchmark Testing**: Conducting benchmark tests to validate the accuracy and reliability of the developed models.

# Intended Use:
This repository serves as a learning resource for the parameters involved in the crystal plasticity finite element modeling process, including simple code examples, case studies, and necessary notes.
