# Description:
**myCheetahSim** is a MATLAB-based code repository designed for the modeling of crystal plasticity using finite element methods. This repository provides a comprehensive framework for simulating the mechanical behavior of crystalline materials under various loading conditions.

# Tasks:
- **Theoretical Framework**: Organizing and compiling the theoretical foundations of crystal plasticity finite element theory.
- **Code Development**: Creating and implementing MATLAB code for crystal plasticity simulations.
- **Benchmark Testing**: Conducting benchmark tests to validate the accuracy and reliability of the developed models.

# Intended Use:
This repository serves as a learning resource for the parameters involved in the crystal plasticity finite element modeling process, including simple code examples, case studies, and necessary notes.

# Introduction

## Getting Started
To initialize the repository and run a simulation, execute the following command in MATLAB:
```matlab
run('scripts/initialize.m');

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the simulation classes.
- `examples/`: Includes example scripts and case studies.
- `scripts/`: Contains initialization and execution scripts.
- `results/`: Directory for storing output results.

## Naming Conventions
- Class Names: Use CamelCase (e.g., CrystalPlasticityModel).
- Global Variable Names: Use camel_case (e.g., global_variable).
- Local Variable Names: Use camelCase (e.g., localVariable).
